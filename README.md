⚡ Generic Interface Console App – C#

A C# Console Application that demonstrates a generic approach using interfaces, enabling flexibility, reusability, and abstraction in application design.

This project is ideal for developers learning interface-based programming and generic patterns in C#.

-------------------------------

🏗️ Overview

The Generic Interface Console App shows how to define and implement interfaces that work with generic types, allowing a single method or service to handle multiple types of objects.

Key benefits:

Abstraction: Hide implementation details behind interfaces

Reusability: Write one generic implementation that works with multiple types

Flexibility: Easily swap implementations without changing consuming code

This approach is widely used in repository patterns, service layers, and other scalable architectures.

🚀 Features
📌 Generic Interface Implementation

Define interfaces with generic type parameters

Implement concrete classes for different entities

Demonstrate polymorphic behavior at runtime

🖥️ Console Interface

Simple menu-driven console UI

Perform operations such as Add, Update, Delete, and Display

🔧 Extensible Design

Easily extendable to new entity types without modifying existing logic

Supports multiple operations through generic methods
